# Wallpapers - *Version II*
This repository is based on my original [repository](https://github.com/makccr/wallpapers) for wallpapers. I've always collected wallpapers, for obvious reasons, but I've kept the repository open to the public in the past because I frequently use these wallpapers on my personal [YouTube channel](https://yt.makc.co). I, of course put the wallpapers into a git repository, just so that I could quickly and easily download these wallpapers on all of my systems (I can also quickly add cloning the repository to a bootstrapping system or something, and that will make it absurdly easy).

I'm not organizing these wallpapers in any specific way, as I have always just ended up randomly picking wallpapers anyway. The main thrust of the new repo actually, is to just focus more on the wallpapers working well with the YouTube channel (I still have my original set for more personal use). The previous wallpaper was very diverse, in-terms of color, style, and resolution. This repository is not. **All wallpapers are 4k (3840x2160), or higher**, and all wallpapers are picked with the intention of having a transparent terminal on top of them, or text on top of them (not necessarily all dark colors or anything, just...) 

I still do keep the original [wallpaper repo](https://github.com/makccr/wallpapers), but that's mainly for me own use (feel free to sift through it if you want though). If you however are coming here from my [YouTube channel](https://yt.makc.co), this is the repo to stick to.
